Resposibilities 
===============

Resposibilities include container Deployment, scaling & descaling of containers


Advantages:
===================

1. Automatically Sheduling==> automatically Sheduling Containers on Cluster nodes 
   =======================
2.Self Healing Capibilities==> k8s will replace or reshedule when container goes down 
  ========================
or node goes down 

3. Roleouts & rollback ===> Roleouts & rollback changes in Docker images  versions changes 
   ===================
4.Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing===> It will support scaling & Load balancing 
  ===================================
K8s can scaleup & scale Down the applications as per the requirements with the simple command 

5. Service Discovery & Load Balancing:
   ===================================

k8s their is no need to worry abount network & communication because kubernets will automatically assign IP addresses and DNS name & Load balancing within the cluster


Containers will gets their own ip Adress if you want to acess we need DNS names for acessing & load balancing inside the cluster 


6. Storage Orchestration:
   =======================

you can mount your storage system as your choice 

eg:NFS EBS

-----------------------------------------------------------


Kubernetes Implements a cluster computing background everything works from inside a kubernetes Cluster

Q) Can I get highly Availibility on 2 master nodes 

A) No we need multi master we need atlease 3 master should be like in Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5, 7)


Kubernetes Architecture
======================

Why k8s is deplicatating docker ?


aftre Docker20.0 they are depricating support but still we can use.

In  1.24 can we use docker ?

In 1.24 they have compleatly remove in 1.24 so we cannot use , insted of docker we can use Docker D , CRIO, ROCKET as Run time
