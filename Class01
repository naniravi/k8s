Resposibilities 
===============

Resposibilities include container Deployment, scaling & descaling of containers


Advantages:
===================

1. Automatically Sheduling==> automatically Sheduling Containers on Cluster nodes 
   =======================
2.Self Healing Capibilities==> k8s will replace or reshedule when container goes down 
  ========================
or node goes down 

3. Roleouts & rollback ===> Roleouts & rollback changes in Docker images  versions changes 
   ===================
4.Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing===> It will support scaling & Load balancing 
  ===================================
K8s can scaleup & scale Down the applications as per the requirements with the simple command 

5. Service Discovery & Load Balancing:
   ===================================

k8s their is no need to worry abount network & communication because kubernets will automatically assign IP addresses and DNS name & Load balancing within the cluster


Containers will gets their own ip Adress if you want to acess we need DNS names for acessing & load balancing inside the cluster 


6. Storage Orchestration:
   =======================

you can mount your storage system as your choice 

eg:NFS EBS

-----------------------------------------------------------


Kubernetes Implements a cluster computing background everything works from inside a kubernetes Cluster

Q) Can I get highly Availibility on 2 master nodes 

A) No we need multi master we need atlease 3 master should be like in Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5, 7)


Kubernetes Architecture
======================

Why k8s is deplicatating docker ?


aftre Docker20.0 they are depricating support but still we can use.

In  1.24 can we use docker ?

In 1.24 they have compleatly remove in 1.24 so we cannot use , insted of docker we can use Docker D , CRIO, ROCKET as Run time 



What components are thier in control plain ?


It will control complete components which are thier in the controlplane 

1)API Server

The name it self it is getting API calls. even though if you are executing any command [updating deploying, creating, deleting]  your are getting API calls



API Server:
-----------------

Q)What is the role of API Server? 

1.API Server is one process this going to intract with  K8s API's it is like frount end for k8s controle plane 


2.The API Server Authenticate& authorize the request before it process the request


Kubectl:
---------------

s.w to intract with control plane 


ETCD:
----------

it is like Key value pair .

It is DB for k8s ,how many volumes,pods Deployment


scheduler:
--------------

Sheduler is going to shedule the pods to the nodes 

Sheduler will scheduled unSheduler pods

Sheduler will check in the etcd Sheduler will scheduled unSheduler pods 
Sheduler will assign nodes to the pods 




 

What ever the command execuited Requests go to Api server & API servers first Authenticate& authorize the before it process the request 


Q)What is Authenticate& authorize?

Authenticate: he is valied user/not & Authentication happen for using certificates /tockens/username& password 


Authorization:Whether that guy has permissions or not .

The API Server Authenticate& authorize the request before it process the request 





Q)How can I intract with API Server?

A)Kubectl Software/ GUI [Graphical User Intrface] Also & to communicate with control plane we use kubectl software


 

     




2)Control manager

3)scheduler 

4)ETCD


What are the K8s Components in worker?

1)Kubelet

2)Kubeproxy


k8s has 2 types of node 

masternode/servers	

worker/slaves/servers/Minions


Q) what is the role of master machine?

A) Master machine is resposible for management of the k8s cluster . Master is the main entry point to manage the k8s Cluster [updating deploying, creating, deleting]
